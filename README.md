## Dev Setup

For now there is a separate README in the Client & Server folders. Here's the short version to get the app running in its current state:

* Do all installations outlined in `Client/README.md` and `Server/README.md`
* `cd Server`
* From `Geckos-Team-05/Server` run:
    ```cli
    node app.js
    ```
* `cd ../Client`
* From `Geckos-Team-05/Client` run:
    ```cli
    npm run build
    npm run start
    ```
